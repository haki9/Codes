# Rules of the 100 Days of Code Challenge

### Main Commitment

##### *I will code for at least an hours every day for next 100 days*

#### Start Date

April 20, 2017

### Additional Rules

* I will tweet about my progress every day -> using hashtag #100DaysOfCode
* If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge
* I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress
* I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress
* I will work on real projects, facing real challenge. The time spent dong tutorial, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

### Ideas to make this challenge more effective

* To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that I add a link to each of the day posts in the Log. It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post.
* If I get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
* If I don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online cources read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
* If I cann't push my code to gitHub for some reason (e.g. if I'm only start to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet(or kipalog). I can think of something else as long as my challenge stays public - and I get the benifit to being **commiting** to it and **accountable** for my process
* Another good bonus: I can practice with Markdown. I'm really really like it.
